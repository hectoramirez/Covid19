# COVID19 interactive visualizations with bokeh and plotly

We create EDAs from the live COVID19 data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The data can be found in [this GitHub data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 

We use the [bokeh](https://bokeh.org) and [plotly](https://plotly.com) visualization libraries.

__The data showed within the notebook is up to April 10th.__

---
Along the notebook, we
1. Clean the data.
2. Show bokeh interactive bar plots for the top countries by confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries and mortality rate.
3. Present the world totals.
4. Compute the daily cases and show bokeh interactive time series plots.
5. We show plotly geographical, interactive maps.

## Interactive plots

The data and the visualizations are updated daily and can be found in [this simple page](https://hectoramirez.github.io/covid/COVID19.html).
