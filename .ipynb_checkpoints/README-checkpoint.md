# COVID19 interactive visualizations

We create EDAs from the live COVID19 data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The data can be found in [this GitHub data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).  

__The data showed within the notebook is up to April 9th.__

---
Along the notebook, we
1. Clean the data.
2. Show bar plots for the top countries by confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries and mortality rate.
3. Present the world totals.
4. Compute the daily cases and show interactive time series plots using the [bokeh](bokeh.org) visualization library.
5. We show geographical, interactive maps using the [plotly](https://plotly.com) visualization library.

## Interactive plots

The data and the visualizations are updated daily and can be found in [this simple page](https://hectoramirez.github.io/covid/COVID19.html).
